# nodePortAddresses is the --nodeport-addresses value for kube-proxy process. Values must be valid
# IP blocks. These values are as a parameter to select the interfaces where nodeport works.
# In case someone would like to expose a service on localhost for local visit and some other interfaces for
# particular purpose, a list of IP blocks would do that.
# If set it to "127.0.0.0/8", kube-proxy will only select the loopback interface for NodePort.
# If set it to a non-zero IP block, kube-proxy will filter that down to just the IPs that applied to the node.
# An empty string slice is meant to select all network interfaces.
